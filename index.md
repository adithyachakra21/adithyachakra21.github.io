# About

Thanks for stopping by! I'm Adithya. I'm currently a master's student in math at the University of Toronto. Here's a bit about me:

### Current Work

- I make math videos on YouTube. I have a YouTube channel called [Aleph 0](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzBjutX2PmitNF4avysL-vg), where I upload short video explainers at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level. I started this channel during my second year of undergrad, with the goal of sharing mathematical stories which wouldn't otherwise receive a lot of exposure online.  

- I work on math research. My research is in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry. I use methods from modular forms and analytic number theory to study special values of $L$-functions and Iwasawa theory. Check out the [Research](/research) tab for some of my recent papers and preprints. See the [Notes](/notes) tab for some expository writing in number theory. 

### Other / Previous Work
- In 2018, I was on the Canadian National Debate Team. On the team, we competed at the World Schools Debating Championships (WSDC) in Croatia, where I ranked 9th Best Speaker in the World. I was also the 2018 Harvard College World Schools Debating Champion.
- In the summer of 2022, I was a R&D intern at [RealSage](https://www.realsage.com/), a Toronto-based real-estate startup which provides data insights to landlords. I developed the Python back-end of RealSage Price, an analytical tool that performs rental price analysis of available properties in a given neighbourhood based on certain parameters. 
- I sing [South Indian classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music). I've been learning and performing ever since I was 8 years old, and it's an important part of who I am. Check out some of my singing [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHNo9IPLB28) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrSQDlLBmEI)!
